If you're a student at the University of Mount Union, this project folder will give you all the source code you need to get up and running with a simple JFrame and other simple elements. \r\n\r\n## MUPanel.java\r\n\r\nA simple JFrame with one JButton which is hooked up to an ActionListener. Clicking the JButton produces output in the console. \r\n\r\n## DregerButton.java\r\n\r\nA Metro-style subclass of JButton. Makes instantiating and customizing colors really easy. For instance: \r\n\r\n```java\r\naButton = new DregerButton(\"Hi!\");\r\naButton.setBounds(10, 10, 140, 40);\r\naButton.setHoverColor(Color.RED);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nWant to help contribute to MU Project? Just fork the project, make changes, and submit a pull request. I'll check for changes periodically. \r\n\r\nYou can reach me on Twitter [@dreger](http://twitter.com/dreger), or through email.
