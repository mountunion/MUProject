# A better way to start your projects

Introducing the new MU Project. If you're a student at the University of Mount Union, this project folder will give you all the source code you need to get up and running with a simple JFrame and other simple elements. 

## MUPanel.java

A simple JFrame with one JButton which is hooked up to an ActionListener. Clicking the JButton produces output in the console. 

## DregerButton.java

A Metro-style subclass of JButton. Makes instantiating and customizing colors really easy. For instance: 

```java
aButton = new DregerButton("Hi!");
aButton.setBounds(10, 10, 140, 40);
aButton.setHoverColor(Color.RED);
```
