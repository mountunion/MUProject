# A better way to start your projects

CS/IS student at the University of Mount Union can use MU Project to get up and running quickly with a simple starter application. 

## MUPanel.java

Just a humble little Frame with several UI elements already hooked up. If you just want the Frame with nothing else, I've marked what to delete from the source code.

## MetroButton.java

A Metro-style subclass of JButton. With a simple style, they can bring a nice aesthetic to any project. Instantiating is super easy; just choose a title and background color (hex code or Color.Something) to get started. Metro Buttons also have a subtle hover effect, which darkens your background color to show focus. 

```java
demoMetroButton = new MetroButton("I'm BLUE!", Color.decode("#71b3c7"));
demoMetroButton.setBounds(50, 220, 100, 50);
demoMetroButton.addActionListener(this);
this.add(demoMetroButton);
```

## Contribute / Problem? 

I'd love to see MU Project grow into a rock solid set of sensible defaults for new Java projects. To help contribute, sign in with your GitHub account, fork the project, make changes, and submit a pull request.
